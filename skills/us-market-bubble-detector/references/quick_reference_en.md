## Emergency Assessment: 3 Questions

When uncertain about an investment decision, answer these 3 questions:

### Q1: "Are non-investors recommending it?"
- YES → Mass penetration complete, likely late stage
- NO → Still early to mid stage

### Q2: "Has the narrative become 'common sense'?"
- YES → Euphoria stage, contrarian views socially unacceptable
- NO → Healthy skepticism still functions

### Q3: "Is 'this time is different' the catchphrase?"
- YES → Classic historical bubble signal
- NO → Healthy caution still present

**All 3 YES → Critical zone, prioritize profit-taking/exit**

## Action Matrix by Bubble Phase

| Phase | Score | Risk Budget | Entry | Profit-Taking | Stop | Short |
|-------|-------|------------|-------|---------------|------|-------|
| **Normal** | 0-4 | 100% | Normal | At target | 2.0 ATR | No |
| **Caution** | 5-8 | 70% | 50% reduced | 25% at +20% | 1.8 ATR | No |
| **Euphoria** | 9-12 | 40% | Stopped | 50% at +20% | 1.5 ATR | After confirm |
| **Critical** | 13-16 | 20% | Stopped | 75-100% now | 1.2 ATR | Recommended |

## Profit-Taking Strategy Templates

### Template 1: Stair-Step (Conservative)

```
Position: $10,000 initial investment
Targets: +20%, +40%, +60%, +80%

+20% ($12,000) → Sell 25% = $3,000 secured
+40% ($14,000) → Sell 25% = $3,500 secured
+60% ($16,000) → Sell 25% = $4,000 secured
+80% ($18,000) → Sell 25% = $4,500 secured

Total profit secured: $15,000 (+50% equivalent)
```

### Template 2: ATR Trailing (Aggressive)

```python
def calculate_trailing_stop(current_price, atr_20d, bubble_phase):
    """
    Calculate trailing stop based on bubble phase

    bubble_phase: 'normal', 'caution', 'euphoria', 'critical'
    """
    multipliers = {
        'normal': 2.0,
        'caution': 1.8,
        'euphoria': 1.5,
        'critical': 1.2
    }
    multiplier = multipliers.get(bubble_phase, 2.0)
    stop_price = current_price - (atr_20d * multiplier)
    return stop_price
```

### Template 3: Hybrid (Recommended)

```
Stage 1 (Boom):
  → Stair-step reduces 50% of position

Stage 2 (Euphoria):
  → Apply ATR trailing to remaining 50%, ride upside

Stage 3 (Panic signals):
  → Exit immediately when ATR stop hit
```

## Short-Selling Timing Decision (Critical)

### ❌ Absolutely Avoid: Early Contrarian

```
Reason: Often 2-3x further rise after "obviously too high"
Risk: "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"
```

### ✅ Recommended: After Composite Conditions Met

**Need at least 3 of 7 conditions before considering:**

1. □ Weekly chart shows clear lower highs
2. □ Volume peaked out (3 weeks declining)
3. □ Leverage metrics drop sharply (margin debt -20%+)
4. □ Media/search trends peaked out
5. □ Weak stocks in sector breaking down first
6. □ VIX spike (+30%+)
7. □ Fed or policy reversal signals

**Execution example:**

```
Conditions check:
[✓] 1. Weekly lower highs
[✓] 2. Volume declining 3 weeks
[×] 3. Margin debt still elevated
[✓] 4. Google trends -40%
[×] 5. Still broad rally
[✓] 6. VIX +35% spike
[×] 7. No policy change

→ 4/7 met, short consideration OK
→ Small size (25% of normal) test entry
```

## Common Failure Patterns & Solutions

### Failure 1: "Too late" mentality, perpetual waiting

**Psychology:** Regret aversion (FOMO about missing out)
**Solution:**
- Run Bubble-O-Meter when feeling too late
- If score ≤8, small entry OK
- If score ≥9, correct to wait

### Failure 2: Re-entry after taking profits (buying high)

**Psychology:** Hindsight bias ("I knew it would go up")
**Solution:**
- 72-hour re-entry ban after profit-taking
- Re-entry only after Bubble-O-Meter check

### Failure 3: "Still going up" paralysis on profit-taking

**Psychology:** Greed + Overconfidence
**Solution:**
- Automate stair-step (preset limit orders)
- Target "satisfaction" not "perfection"

### Failure 4: Premature short selling

**Psychology:** Subjective "obviously too high"
**Solution:**
- Mechanically check composite conditions
- Wait for minimum 3 conditions
