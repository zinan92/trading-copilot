## Top Risk Rules

### Trade count inversely correlates with performance in flat markets: 3-6 trades = ~$0 PnL, 70-180 trades = -$55 to -$141, 150-225 trades = -$325 to -$581
- Success rate: 95%
- Based on 861 observations
- Confidence: 55% (seen 1 times)
- First identified: 2026-01-13

### Trade frequency should adapt to market regime: mixed/choppy markets require 0-10 trades/24h maximum. 201 trades = -$360.24, 2 trades = -$0.29, 0 trades = $0.00.
- Success rate: 95%
- Based on 950 observations
- Confidence: 95% (seen 1 times)
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Validate risk per trade explicitly before entry. skill_aware_oss reasoning includes 'risk per trade within limits' and 'portfolio risk is within limits' - this validation step correlates with +$1349 PnL.
- Success rate: 92%
- Based on 157 observations
- Confidence: 65% (seen 1 times)
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Validate risk per trade explicitly before entry with 2% equity risk and 2:1 reward ratio. skill_aware_oss reasoning includes 'risk/reward is 2:1 with 2% equity risk' and 'trade validation passed', achieving best performance (+$1379.66).
- Success rate: 92%
- Based on 164 observations
- Confidence: 70% (seen 1 times)
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trade frequency should adapt to market regime: moderate bull markets require 0-30 trades/24h maximum. Above 100 trades correlates with losses (-$50 to -$264).
- Success rate: 92%
- Based on 895 observations
- Confidence: 95% (seen 1 times)
- First identified: 2026-01-17

## General Guidelines

- Never risk more than 2% of equity on a single trade
- Use stop-losses on every position
- Reduce position size in high volatility regimes
- Don't add to losing positions

## Confidence Guide

| Confidence | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| 90%+ | High confidence - strong historical support |
| 70-90% | Moderate confidence - use with other signals |
| 60-70% | Low confidence - consider as one input |
| <60% | Experimental - needs more data |
