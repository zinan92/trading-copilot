# Theme Detector

## Overview

This skill detects and ranks trending market themes by analyzing cross-sector momentum, volume, and breadth signals. It identifies both bullish (upward momentum) and bearish (downward pressure) themes, assesses lifecycle maturity (early/mid/late/exhaustion), and provides a confidence score combining quantitative data with narrative analysis.

**3-Dimensional Scoring Model:**
1. **Theme Heat** (0-100): Direction-neutral strength of the theme (momentum, volume, uptrend ratio, breadth)
2. **Lifecycle Maturity**: Stage classification (Early / Mid / Late / Exhaustion) based on duration, extremity clustering, valuation, and ETF proliferation
3. **Confidence** (Low / Medium / High): Reliability of the detection, combining quantitative breadth with narrative confirmation

**Key Features:**
- Cross-sector theme detection using FINVIZ industry data
- Direction-aware scoring (bullish and bearish themes)
- Lifecycle maturity assessment to identify crowded vs. emerging trades
- ETF proliferation scoring (more ETFs = more mature/crowded theme)
- Integration with uptrend-dashboard for 3-point evaluation
- Dual-mode operation: FINVIZ Elite (fast) or public scraping (slower, limited)
- WebSearch-based narrative confirmation for top themes

## When to Use This Skill

**Explicit Triggers:**
- "What market themes are trending right now?"
- "Which sectors are hot/cold?"
- "Detect current market themes"
- "What are the strongest bullish/bearish narratives?"
- "Is AI/clean energy/defense still a strong theme?"
- "Where is sector rotation heading?"
- "Show me thematic investing opportunities"

**Implicit Triggers:**
- User wants to understand broad market narrative shifts
- User is looking for thematic ETF or sector allocation ideas
- User asks about crowded trades or late-cycle themes
- User wants to know which themes are emerging vs. exhausted

**When NOT to Use:**
- Individual stock analysis (use us-stock-analysis instead)
- Specific sector deep-dive with chart reading (use sector-analyst instead)
- Portfolio rebalancing (use portfolio-manager instead)
- Dividend/income investing (use value-dividend-screener instead)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Requirements

Check for required API keys and dependencies:

```bash
# Check for FINVIZ Elite API key (optional but recommended)
echo $FINVIZ_API_KEY

# Check for FMP API key (optional, used for valuation metrics)
echo $FMP_API_KEY
```

**Requirements:**
- **Python 3.7+** with `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`
- **FINVIZ Elite API key** (recommended for full industry coverage and speed)
- **FMP API key** (optional, for P/E ratio valuation data)
- Without FINVIZ Elite, the skill uses public FINVIZ scraping (limited to ~20 stocks per industry, slower rate limits)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

### Step 2: Execute Theme Detection Script

Run the main detection script:

```bash
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --output-dir reports/
```

**Script Options:**
```bash
# Full run (public FINVIZ mode, no API key required)
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --output-dir reports/

# With FINVIZ Elite API key
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --finviz-api-key $FINVIZ_API_KEY \
  --output-dir reports/

# With FMP API key for enhanced stock data
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --fmp-api-key $FMP_API_KEY \
  --output-dir reports/

# Custom limits
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --max-themes 5 \
  --max-stocks-per-theme 5 \
  --output-dir reports/

# Explicit FINVIZ mode
python3 skills/theme-detector/scripts/theme_detector.py \
  --finviz-mode public \
  --output-dir reports/
```

**Expected Execution Time:**
- FINVIZ Elite mode: ~2-3 minutes (14+ themes)
- Public FINVIZ mode: ~5-8 minutes (rate-limited scraping)

### Step 3: Read and Parse Detection Results

The script generates two output files:
- `theme_detector_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json` - Structured data for programmatic use
- `theme_detector_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` - Human-readable report

Read the JSON output to understand quantitative results:

```bash
# Find the latest report
ls -lt reports/theme_detector_*.json | head -1

# Read the JSON output
cat reports/theme_detector_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json
```

### Step 4: Perform Narrative Confirmation via WebSearch

For the top 5 themes (by Theme Heat score), execute WebSearch queries to confirm narrative strength:

**Search Pattern:**
```
"[theme name] stocks market [current month] [current year]"
"[theme name] sector momentum [current month] [current year]"
```

**Evaluate narrative signals:**
- **Strong narrative**: Multiple major outlets covering the theme, analyst upgrades, policy catalysts
- **Moderate narrative**: Some coverage, mixed sentiment, no clear catalyst
- **Weak narrative**: Little coverage, or predominantly contrarian/skeptical tone

Update Confidence levels based on findings:
- Quantitative High + Narrative Strong = **High** confidence
- Quantitative High + Narrative Weak = **Medium** confidence (possible momentum divergence)
- Quantitative Low + Narrative Strong = **Medium** confidence (narrative may lead price)
- Quantitative Low + Narrative Weak = **Low** confidence

### Step 5: Analyze Results and Provide Recommendations

Cross-reference detection results with knowledge bases:

**Reference Documents to Consult:**
1. `references/cross_sector_themes.md` - Theme definitions and constituent industries
2. `references/thematic_etf_catalog.md` - ETF exposure options by theme
3. `references/theme_detection_methodology.md` - Scoring model details
4. `references/finviz_industry_codes.md` - Industry classification reference

**Analysis Framework:**

For **Hot Bullish Themes** (Heat >= 70, Direction = Bullish):
- Identify lifecycle stage (Early = opportunity, Late/Exhaustion = caution)
- List top-performing industries within the theme
- Recommend proxy ETFs for exposure
- Flag if ETF proliferation is high (crowded trade warning)

For **Hot Bearish Themes** (Heat >= 70, Direction = Bearish):
- Identify industries under pressure
- Assess if bearish momentum is accelerating or decelerating
- Recommend hedging strategies or sectors to avoid
- Note potential mean-reversion opportunities if lifecycle is Late/Exhaustion

For **Emerging Themes** (Heat 40-69, Lifecycle = Early):
- These may represent early rotation signals
- Recommend monitoring with watchlist
- Identify catalyst events that could accelerate the theme

For **Exhausted Themes** (Heat >= 60, Lifecycle = Exhaustion):
- Warn about crowded trade risk
- High ETF count confirms excessive retail participation
- Consider contrarian positioning or reducing exposure

### Step 6: Generate Final Report

Present the final report to the user using the report template structure:

```markdown

## Important Notes

### FINVIZ Mode Differences

| Feature | Elite Mode | Public Mode |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Industry coverage | All ~145 industries | All ~145 industries |
| Stocks per industry | Full universe | ~20 stocks (page 1) |
| Rate limiting | 0.5s between requests | 2.0s between requests |
| Data freshness | Real-time | 15-min delayed |
| API key required | Yes ($39.99/mo) | No |
| Execution time | ~2-3 minutes | ~5-8 minutes |

### Direction Detection Logic

Theme direction (bullish vs. bearish) is determined by:
1. **Weighted industry performance**: Average change% across constituent industries, weighted by market cap
2. **Uptrend ratio**: Percentage of stocks in each industry that are in technical uptrends (if uptrend data available)
3. **Volume confirmation**: Whether volume supports the price direction (accumulation vs. distribution)

A theme is classified as:
- **Bullish**: Weighted performance > 0 AND (uptrend ratio > 50% OR volume accumulation confirmed)
- **Bearish**: Weighted performance < 0 AND (uptrend ratio < 50% OR volume distribution confirmed)
- **Neutral**: Mixed signals or insufficient data

### Known Limitations

1. **Survivorship bias**: Only analyzes currently listed stocks and ETFs
2. **Lag**: FINVIZ data may lag intraday moves by 15 minutes (public mode)
3. **Theme boundaries**: Some stocks fit multiple themes; classification uses primary industry
4. **ETF proliferation**: Catalog is static and may not capture very new ETFs
5. **Narrative scoring**: WebSearch-based and inherently subjective
6. **Public mode limitation**: ~20 stocks per industry may miss small-cap signals

### Disclaimer

**This analysis is for educational and informational purposes only.**
- Not investment advice
- Past thematic trends do not guarantee future performance
- Theme detection identifies momentum, not fundamental value
- Conduct your own research before making investment decisions
