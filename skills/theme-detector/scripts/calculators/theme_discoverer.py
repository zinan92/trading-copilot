"""Theme Discoverer - Automatic theme detection from unmatched industries.

Finds clusters of unmatched industries with similar performance patterns
and generates new theme entries compatible with classify_themes() output.

Algorithm:
1. Extract top_n and bottom_n from ranked_industries, exclude matched names.
2. Separate into bullish (top) and bearish (bottom) groups.
3. Sort each group by weighted_return.
4. Cluster adjacent industries that satisfy BOTH:
   a. weighted_return gap <= gap_threshold
   b. perf vector distance <= vector_threshold (normalized Euclidean)
5. Filter clusters by min_cluster_size.
6. Exclude clusters that overlap significantly with existing themes.
7. Auto-name clusters from industry name tokens.
