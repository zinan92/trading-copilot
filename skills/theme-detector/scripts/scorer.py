"""
Theme Detector - Scoring, Labeling & Confidence

Combines theme heat and lifecycle maturity into a final theme score dict.
Follows the pattern from macro-regime-detector/scripts/scorer.py.

Design Note on Confidence Levels:
    narrative_confirmed is intentionally set to False in the script output.
    This is by design: Claude performs WebSearch-based narrative confirmation
    as a post-processing step. Script-only output therefore has a maximum
    confidence of "Medium" (quant_confirmed + breadth_confirmed = 2 layers).
    After Claude confirms narrative alignment, confidence can reach "High".
