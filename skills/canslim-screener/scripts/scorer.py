CANSLIM Composite Scoring Engine - Phase 3 (Full CANSLIM)

Combines individual component scores into weighted composite score.
Supports Phase 1 (4 components), Phase 2 (6 components), and Phase 3 (7 components).

Phase 3 Weights (Full CANSLIM - Original O'Neil weights):
- C (Current Earnings): 15%
- A (Annual Growth): 20%
- N (Newness): 15%
- S (Supply/Demand): 15%
- L (Leadership/RS Rank): 20%
- I (Institutional): 10%
- M (Market Direction): 5%
Total: 100%

Interpretation Bands:
- 90-100: Exceptional+ (rare multi-bagger setup)
- 80-89: Exceptional (outstanding fundamentals)
- 70-79: Strong (solid across all components)
- 60-69: Above Average (meets thresholds)
- 50-59: Average (marginal)
- 40-49: Below Average (one or more weak)
- <40: Weak (fails CANSLIM criteria)
