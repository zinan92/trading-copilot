N Component - Newness / New Highs Calculator

Calculates CANSLIM 'N' component score based on price position relative to
52-week high and momentum indicators.

O'Neil's Rule: "Stocks making new price highs have no overhead supply.
New products, services, or management catalyze major moves."

Scoring:
- 100: Within 5% of 52-week high + breakout + new product catalyst
- 80: Within 10% of 52-week high + breakout
- 60: Within 15% of 52-week high OR breakout
- 40: Within 25% of 52-week high
- 20: >25% from 52-week high (lacks momentum)
