I Component - Institutional Sponsorship Calculator (Full Implementation)

Calculates CANSLIM 'I' component score based on institutional holder count and ownership percentage.

O'Neil's Rule: "You need some of the big boys on your side. Look for stocks with increasing
institutional sponsorship, but not too much. The sweet spot is 50-100 institutional holders
with 30-60% ownership."

Key Principles:
- 50-100 holders: Enough interest, not overcrowded
- 30-60% ownership: Strong backing without lock-up
- <30%: Underowned (potential upside, but may lack institutional support)
- >80%: Overcrowded (no buying power left, vulnerable to selling)
- Superinvestors (Berkshire, Baupost, etc.): Quality signal

Scoring:
- 100 points: 50-100 holders + 30-60% ownership (O'Neil's sweet spot)
- 90 points: Superinvestor present + good holder count
- 80 points: 30-50 holders + 20-40% ownership OR 100-150 holders + 40-70% ownership
- 60 points: Acceptable but suboptimal ranges
- 40 points: <20% or >80% ownership
- 20 points: <10% or >90% ownership
- 0 points: Institutional data unavailable or extreme ranges
