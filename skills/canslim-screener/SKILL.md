# CANSLIM Stock Screener - Phase 3 (Full CANSLIM)

## Overview

This skill screens US stocks using William O'Neil's proven CANSLIM methodology, a systematic approach for identifying growth stocks with strong fundamentals and price momentum. CANSLIM analyzes 7 key components: **C**urrent Earnings, **A**nnual Growth, **N**ewness/New Highs, **S**upply/Demand, **L**eadership/RS Rank, **I**nstitutional Sponsorship, and **M**arket Direction.

**Phase 3** implements all 7 of 7 components (C, A, N, S, L, I, M), representing **100% of the full methodology**.

**Two-Stage Approach:**
1. **Stage 1 (FMP API + Finviz)**: Analyze stock universe with all 7 CANSLIM components
2. **Stage 2 (Reporting)**: Rank by composite score and generate actionable reports

**Key Features:**
- Composite scoring (0-100 scale) with weighted components
- **Finviz fallback** for institutional ownership data (automatic when FMP data incomplete)
- Progressive filtering to optimize API usage
- JSON + Markdown output formats
- Interpretation bands: Exceptional+ (90+), Exceptional (80-89), Strong (70-79), Above Average (60-69)
- Bear market protection (M component gating)

**Phase 3 Component Weights (Original O'Neil weights):**
- C (Current Earnings): 15%
- A (Annual Growth): 20%
- N (Newness): 15%
- S (Supply/Demand): 15%
- L (Leadership/RS Rank): 20%
- I (Institutional): 10%
- M (Market Direction): 5%

**Future Phases:**
- Phase 4: FINVIZ Elite integration → 10x faster execution

## When to Use This Skill

**Explicit Triggers:**
- "Find CANSLIM stocks"
- "Screen for growth stocks using O'Neil's method"
- "Which stocks have strong earnings and momentum?"
- "Identify stocks near 52-week highs with accelerating earnings"
- "Run a CANSLIM screener on [sector/universe]"

**Implicit Triggers:**
- User wants to identify multi-bagger candidates
- User is looking for growth stocks with proven fundamentals
- User wants systematic stock selection based on historical winners
- User needs a ranked list of stocks meeting O'Neil's criteria

**When NOT to Use:**
- Value investing focus (use value-dividend-screener instead)
- Income/dividend focus (use dividend-growth-pullback-screener instead)
- Bear market conditions (M component will flag - consider raising cash)

---

## Prerequisites

**API Requirements:**
- **FMP API key** (free tier: 250 calls/day, sufficient for 35 stocks; Starter tier $29.99/mo for 40+ stocks)
  - Sign up: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs
  - Set via environment variable: `export FMP_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**Python Dependencies:**
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` (FMP API calls)
- `beautifulsoup4` (Finviz web scraping)
- `lxml` (HTML parsing)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

---

## Output

**Output Directory:** `reports/` (default) or custom via `--output-dir`

**Generated Files:**
- `canslim_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json` - Structured data for programmatic use
- `canslim_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` - Human-readable report

**Report Contents:**
- Market Condition Summary (trend, M score, warnings)
- Top N CANSLIM Candidates (ranked by composite score)
- Component Breakdown for each stock (C, A, N, S, L, I, M scores with details)
- Rating interpretation (Exceptional+/Exceptional/Strong/Above Average)
- Quality warnings and data source notes
- Summary statistics (rating distribution)

**Rating Bands:**
- **Exceptional+ (90-100):** All components near-perfect, aggressive buy
- **Exceptional (80-89):** Outstanding fundamentals + momentum, strong buy
- **Strong (70-79):** Solid across components, standard buy
- **Above Average (60-69):** Meets thresholds with minor weaknesses, buy on pullback

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify API Access and Requirements

Check if user has FMP API key configured:

```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $FMP_API_KEY

# If not set, prompt user to provide it
```

**Requirements:**
- **FMP API key** (free tier: 250 calls/day, sufficient for 40 stocks)
- **Python 3.7+** with required libraries:
  - `requests` (FMP API calls)
  - `beautifulsoup4` (Finviz web scraping)
  - `lxml` (HTML parsing)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

If API key is missing, guide user to:
1. Sign up at https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs
2. Get free API key (250 calls/day)
3. Set environment variable: `export FMP_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Step 2: Determine Stock Universe

**Option A: Default Universe (Recommended)**
Use top 40 S&P 500 stocks by market cap (predefined in script):

```bash
python3 skills/canslim-screener/scripts/screen_canslim.py
```

**Option B: Custom Universe**
User provides specific symbols or sector:

```bash
python3 skills/canslim-screener/scripts/screen_canslim.py \
  --universe AAPL MSFT GOOGL AMZN NVDA META TSLA
```

**Option C: Sector-Specific**
User can provide sector-focused list (Technology, Healthcare, etc.)

**API Budget Considerations (Phase 3):**
- 40 stocks × 7 FMP calls/stock = 280 API calls
  - FMP: 7 calls/stock (profile, quote, income×2, historical_90d, historical_365d, institutional)
  - Finviz: ~1.8 calls/stock (institutional ownership fallback, 2s rate limit, not counted in FMP budget)
- Market data (^GSPC quote, ^VIX quote, ^GSPC 52-week history): 3 FMP calls
- Total: ~283 FMP calls per screening run (exceeds 250 free tier)
- **Recommendation**: Use `--max-candidates 35` for free tier (35 × 7 + 3 = 248 calls), or upgrade to FMP Starter tier ($29.99/mo, 750 calls/day) for full 40-stock screening

### Step 3: Execute CANSLIM Screening Script

Run the main screening script with appropriate parameters:

```bash
cd skills/canslim-screener/scripts

# Basic run (40 stocks, top 20 in report)
python3 screen_canslim.py --api-key $FMP_API_KEY

# Custom parameters
python3 screen_canslim.py \
  --api-key $FMP_API_KEY \
  --max-candidates 40 \
  --top 20 \
  --output-dir ../../../
```

**Script Workflow (Phase 3 - Full CANSLIM):**
1. **Market Direction (M)**: Analyze S&P 500 trend vs 50-day EMA (using real historical data for accurate EMA)
   - If bear market detected (M=0), warn user to raise cash
2. **S&P 500 Historical Data**: Fetch 52-week data for M component EMA and L component RS calculation
3. **Stock Analysis**: For each stock, calculate:
   - **C Component**: Quarterly EPS/revenue growth (YoY)
   - **A Component**: 3-year EPS CAGR and stability
   - **N Component**: Distance from 52-week high, breakout detection
   - **S Component**: Volume-based accumulation/distribution (up-day vs down-day volume)
   - **L Component**: 52-week Relative Strength vs S&P 500
   - **I Component**: Institutional holder count + ownership % (with Finviz fallback)
4. **Composite Scoring**: Weighted average with all 7 component breakdown
5. **Ranking**: Sort by composite score (highest first)
6. **Reporting**: Generate JSON + Markdown outputs

**Expected Execution Time (Phase 3):**
- 40 stocks: **~2 minutes** (additional 52-week history fetch per stock for L component)
- Finviz fallback adds ~2 seconds per stock (rate limiting)
- L component requires 365-day historical data for each stock

**Finviz Fallback Behavior:**
- Triggers automatically when FMP `sharesOutstanding` unavailable
- Scrapes institutional ownership % from Finviz.com (free, no API key)
- Increases I component accuracy from 35/100 (partial data) to 60-100/100 (full data)
- User sees: `✅ Using Finviz institutional ownership for NVDA: 68.3%`

### Step 4: Read and Parse Screening Results

The script generates two output files:
- `canslim_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json` - Structured data
- `canslim_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md` - Human-readable report

Read the Markdown report to identify top candidates:

```bash
# Find the latest report
ls -lt canslim_screener_*.md | head -1

# Read the report
cat canslim_screener_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md
```

**Report Structure (Phase 3 - Full CANSLIM):**
- Market Condition Summary (trend, M score, warnings)
- Top N CANSLIM Candidates (ranked, N = --top parameter)
- For each stock:
  - Composite Score and Rating (Exceptional+/Exceptional/Strong/etc.)
  - Component Breakdown (C, A, N, S, L, I, M scores with details)
  - Interpretation (rating description, guidance, weakest component)
  - Warnings (quality issues, market conditions, data source notes)
- Summary Statistics (rating distribution)
- Methodology note (Phase 3: 7 components, 100% coverage)

**Component Details in Report:**
- **S Component**: "Up/Down Volume Ratio: 1.06 ✓ Accumulation"
- **L Component**: "52wk: +45.2% (+22.1% vs S&P) RS: 88"
- **I Component**: "6199 holders, 68.3% ownership ⭐ Superinvestor"

### Step 5: Analyze Top Candidates and Provide Recommendations

Review the top-ranked stocks and cross-reference with knowledge bases:

**Reference Documents to Consult:**
1. `references/interpretation_guide.md` - Understand rating bands and portfolio sizing
2. `references/canslim_methodology.md` - Deep dive into component meanings (now includes S and I)
3. `references/scoring_system.md` - Understand scoring formulas (Phase 3 weights)

**Analysis Framework:**

For **Exceptional+ stocks (90-100 points)**:
- All components near-perfect (C≥85, A≥85, N≥85, S≥80, L≥85, I≥80, M≥80)
- Guidance: Immediate buy, aggressive position sizing (15-20% of portfolio)
- Example: "NVDA scores 97.2 - explosive quarterly earnings (100), strong 3-year growth (95), at new highs (98), volume accumulation (85), RS leader (92), strong institutional support (90), uptrend market (100)"

For **Exceptional stocks (80-89 points)**:
- Outstanding fundamentals + strong momentum
- Guidance: Strong buy, standard sizing (10-15% of portfolio)

For **Strong stocks (70-79 points)**:
- Solid across all components, minor weaknesses
- Guidance: Buy, standard sizing (8-12% of portfolio)
- Phase 3 Example: "Stock scores 77.5 - strong earnings (85), solid growth (80), near high (70), accumulation (60), RS leader (75), good institutions (60), uptrend (90)"

For **Above Average stocks (60-69 points)**:
- Meets thresholds, one component weak
- Guidance: Buy on pullback, conservative sizing (5-8% of portfolio)

**Bear Market Override:**
- If M component = 0 (bear market detected), **do NOT buy** regardless of other scores
- Guidance: Raise 80-100% cash, wait for market recovery
- CANSLIM does not work in bear markets (3 out of 4 stocks follow market trend)

### Step 6: Generate User-Facing Report

Create a concise, actionable summary for the user:

**Report Format:**

```markdown
# CANSLIM Stock Screening Results (Phase 3 - Full CANSLIM)
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Market Condition:** [Trend] - M Score: [X]/100
**Stocks Analyzed:** [N]
**Components:** C, A, N, S, L, I, M (7 of 7, 100% coverage)

## Market Summary
[2-3 sentences on current market environment based on M component]
[If bear market: WARNING - Consider raising cash allocation]

## Top 5 CANSLIM Candidates

### 1. [SYMBOL] - [Company Name] ⭐⭐⭐

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: FMP API Rate Limit Exceeded

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: 429 Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded
Retrying in 60 seconds...
```

**Causes:**
- Running multiple screenings within short time window
- Exceeding 250 calls/day (free tier limit)
- Other applications using same API key

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait and Retry**: Script auto-retries after 60s
2. **Reduce Universe**: Use `--max-candidates 30` to lower API usage
3. **Check Daily Usage**: Free tier resets at midnight UTC
4. **Upgrade Plan**: FMP Starter ($29.99/month) provides 750 calls/day

### Issue 2: Missing Required Libraries

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: required libraries not found. Install with: pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Install all required libraries
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml

# Or install individually
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
pip install lxml
```

### Issue 3: Finviz Fallback Slow Execution

**Symptoms:**
```
Execution time: 2 minutes 30 seconds for 40 stocks (slower than expected)
```

**Causes:**
- Finviz rate limiting (2.0s per request)
- All stocks triggering fallback due to FMP data gaps

**Solutions:**
1. **Accept Delay**: 1-2 minutes for 40 stocks is normal with Finviz fallback
2. **Monitor Fallback Usage**: Check logs for "Using Finviz institutional ownership" messages
3. **Reduce Rate Limit** (advanced): Edit `finviz_stock_client.py`, change `rate_limit_seconds=2.0` to `1.5` (risk: IP ban)

**Note:** Finviz fallback adds ~2 seconds per stock but significantly improves I component accuracy (35 → 60-100 points).

### Issue 4: Finviz Web Scraping Failure

**Symptoms:**
```
WARNING: Finviz request failed with status 403 for NVDA
⚠️ Using Finviz institutional ownership data - FMP shares outstanding unavailable. Finviz fallback also unavailable. Score reduced by 50%.
```

**Causes:**
- Finviz blocking scraping requests (User-Agent detection)
- Rate limit exceeded (too many requests)
- Network issues or Finviz downtime

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait and Retry**: Rate limit resets after a few minutes
2. **Check Internet Connection**: Verify network access to finviz.com
3. **Fallback Accepted**: Script continues with FMP holder count only (I score capped at 70/100)
4. **Manual Verification**: Check Finviz website manually for blocked IP

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Script never fails due to Finviz issues
- Falls back to FMP holder count only
- User sees quality warning in report

### Issue 5: No Stocks Meet Minimum Thresholds

**Symptoms:**
```
✓ Successfully analyzed 40 stocks
Top 5 Stocks:
  1. AAPL  -  58.3 (Average)
  2. MSFT  -  55.1 (Average)
  ...
```

**Causes:**
- Bear market conditions (M component low)
- Selected universe lacks growth stocks
- Market rotation away from growth

**Solutions:**
1. **Check M Component**: If M=0 (bear market), raise cash per CANSLIM rules
2. **Expand Universe**: Try different sectors or market cap ranges
3. **Lower Expectations**: Average scores (55-65) may still be actionable in weak markets
4. **Wait for Better Setup**: CANSLIM works best in bull markets

### Issue 6: Data Quality Warnings

**Symptoms:**
```
⚠️ Revenue declining despite EPS growth (possible buyback distortion)
⚠️ Using Finviz institutional ownership data (68.3%) - FMP shares outstanding unavailable.
```

**Interpretation:**
- These are **not errors** - they are quality flags from calculators
- Revenue warning: EPS growth may be from share buybacks, not organic growth
- Finviz warning: Data source switched from FMP to Finviz (still accurate)

**Actions:**
1. Review component details in full report
2. Cross-check with fundamental analysis
3. Adjust position sizing based on risk level
4. Finviz data is reliable - no action needed for data source warnings

## Important Notes

### Phase 3 Implementation Status

This is **Phase 3** implementing all 7 of 7 CANSLIM components:
- ✅ **C** (Current Earnings) - Implemented
- ✅ **A** (Annual Growth) - Implemented
- ✅ **N** (Newness) - Implemented
- ✅ **S** (Supply/Demand) - Implemented
- ✅ **L** (Leadership/RS Rank) - Implemented
- ✅ **I** (Institutional) - Implemented
- ✅ **M** (Market Direction) - Implemented

**Implications:**
- Composite scores represent **100% of full CANSLIM methodology**
- Uses original O'Neil component weights (C 15%, A 20%, N 15%, S 15%, L 20%, I 10%, M 5%)
- L component (20% weight) is the largest individual factor alongside A, emphasizing relative strength leadership
- M component uses real 50-day EMA from historical data (not fallback estimate)

### Finviz Integration Benefits

**Automatic Fallback System:**
- When FMP API doesn't provide `sharesOutstanding`, Finviz automatically activates
- Scrapes institutional ownership % from Finviz.com (free, no API key)
- Improves I component accuracy from 35/100 (partial) to 60-100/100 (full)

**Data Source Priority:**
1. **FMP API** (primary): Institutional holder count + shares outstanding calculation
2. **Finviz** (fallback): Direct institutional ownership % from web page
3. **Partial Data** (last resort): Holder count only, 50% penalty applied

**Tested Reliability:**
- 39/39 stocks successfully retrieved ownership % via Finviz (100% success rate)
- Average execution time: 2.54 seconds per stock
- No errors or IP blocks during testing

### Future Enhancements

**Phase 4 (Planned):**
- FINVIZ Elite integration for pre-screening
- Execution time: 2 minutes → 10-15 seconds
- FMP API usage reduction: 90%
- Larger universe possible (100+ stocks)

### Data Source Attribution

- **FMP API**: Income statements, quotes, historical prices, key metrics, institutional holders
- **Finviz**: Institutional ownership % (fallback), market data
- **Methodology**: William O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks" (4th edition)
- **Scoring System**: Adapted from IBD MarketSmith proprietary system

### Disclaimer

**This screener is for educational and informational purposes only.**
- Not investment advice
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- CANSLIM methodology works best in bull markets (M component confirms)
- Conduct your own research and consult a financial advisor before making investment decisions
- O'Neil's historical winners include AAPL (2009: +1,200%), NFLX (2013: +800%), but many stocks fail to perform
